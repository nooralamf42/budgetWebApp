# budgetWebAppâœ¨
Introducing my new web app for budgeting! With a modern design created using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, the app makes tracking finances simple and fun. It even features sound effects that play when you add or deduct money. You can add tags to expenses to monitor where money is going.
